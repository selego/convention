## Consistency is key

Consistency is defined as: sameness, conformity, uniformity.

``` Consistently bad is better than inconsistently good. ```

Imagine a system initially developed with Technique A. A new software developer joins, and starts using technique B, which is objectively better than Technique A. Years later, that software developer is replaced by another developer, who uses Technique C, an arguably better technique than either Technique A or Technique B. Let this repeat.
What you end up with is a software system with X number of ways of doing the same thing. You use up precious brain-space to accommodate the X different methods of doing things, and you can never really be sure which way youâ€™ll be encountering in your codebase.

Although beneficial when taken individually, the improvements as a group introduced inconsistency which made the system harder to reason about over time.

Code should look like it was written by a single individual.
