| ------  | ------ |

## Insecure Deserialization

| To check  | Status |
| ------  | ------ |

## Using components with known vulnerabilities

| To check  | Status |
| ------  | ------ |
| Remove all unused libraries/modules/frameworks/files/documentation | [ ] Todo |
| Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and server-side components (e.g. frameworks, libraries) and their dependencies using tools like versions, DependencyCheck, retire.js, etc. Continuously monitor sources like CVE and NVD for vulnerabilities in the components. Use software composition analysis tools to automate the process.  | [ ] Todo |
| Subscribe to email alerts for security vulnerabilities related to components you use. | [ ] Todo |
